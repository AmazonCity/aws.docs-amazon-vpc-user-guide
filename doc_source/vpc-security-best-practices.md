# Security best practices for your VPC<a name="vpc-security-best-practices"></a>

 The following best practices are general guidelines and donâ€™t represent a complete security solution\. Because these best practices might not be appropriate or sufficient for your environment, treat them as helpful considerations rather than prescriptions\.
+ When you add subnets to your VPC to host your application, create them in multiple Availability Zones\. An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region\. Using multiple Availability Zones makes your production applications highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable\. For more information, see [Building a Modular and Scalable Virtual Network Architecture with Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/vpc/architecture.html)\.
+ Use network ACLs to control access to your subnets and use security groups to control traffic to EC2 instances in your subnets\. For more information, see [Control traffic to subnets using Network ACLs](vpc-network-acls.md) and [Control traffic to resources using security groups](VPC_SecurityGroups.md)\.
+ Manage access to AWS VPC resources and APIs using AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) identity federation, users, and roles\. For more information, see [Identity and access management for Amazon VPC](security-iam.md)\.
+ Use Amazon CloudWatch with VPC flow logs to monitor the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC\. For more information, see [Publish flow logs to CloudWatch Logs](flow-logs-cwl.md)\.
